# CSC 133 Object-Oriented Computer Graphics Programming

> Introduction to computer graphics and advanced topics in object-oriented (OO) programming. The OO paradigm is used throughout, utilizing computer graphics as the vehicle for solidifying basic OO concepts, studying the implementation of event-driven systems, and for developing a thorough understanding of advanced OO concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. Topics include fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, software design patterns, graphic devices, line and surface drawing, simple 2D and 3D representation, and use of User Interface components.
